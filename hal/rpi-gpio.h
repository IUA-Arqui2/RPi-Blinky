/** The GPIO Peripheral is described in section 6 of the BCM2835 Peripherals
    documentation.

    There are 54 general-purpose I/O (GPIO) lines split into two banks. All
    GPIO pins have at least two alternative functions within BCM. The
    alternate functions are usually peripheral IO and a single peripheral
    may appear in each bank to allow flexibility on the choice of IO voltage.
    Details of alternative functions are given in section 6.2. Alternative
    Function Assignments.

    The GPIO peripheral has three dedicated interrupt lines. These lines are
    triggered by the setting of bits in the event detect status register. Each
    bank has itsâ€™ own interrupt line with the third line shared between all
    bits.

    The Alternate function table also has the pull state (pull-up/pull-down)
    which is applied after a power down. */
